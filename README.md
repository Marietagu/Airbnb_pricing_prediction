# Montreal Airbnb Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict Airbnb rental prices in Montreal using data sourced from Inside Airbnb. The goal is to uncover the relationship between rental prices and various features such as neighborhood, room type, and the number of bathrooms, and to develop predictive models that can accurately estimate rental prices based on these features.

## Data Source
The data for this project was obtained from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), an independent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows users to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world.

## File Descriptions
- `data_wrangling_listings.ipynb`: This notebook contains all the data cleaning and preprocessing steps, preparing the data for analysis and modeling.
- `EDA_listings.ipynb`: This notebook performs exploratory data analysis to visualize and understand the trends and patterns in the data.
- `Preprocessing_and_Modeling_listings.ipynb`: This notebook describes the feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation processes used to predict Airbnb prices.

## Results
The project includes a comparative analysis of multiple regression models to predict the Airbnb rental prices. Key metrics used to evaluate the models include Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.
